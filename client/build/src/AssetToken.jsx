<h1>Navigate Toward the Era of Asset Backed Tokenization</h1>
<p>Asset backed tokenization is the process of converting the value of any physical asset into a digital token
that can be traded over an exchange. Using Blockchain, the transfer of ownership and storage can be performed speedily
without any dependency on a centralized finance entity.</p>

<h1>Digital Asset Tokenization: Unlocking New Possibilities</h1>
<p>Blockchain has an ambition to create a democratic financial environment wherein the subscribers such as investors, lenders and borrowers hold complete authority over their assets. With asset tokenization solutions, businesses have discovered a powerful channel to put underutilized or any illiquid assets to productive use.</p>
<p>Besides liquidating the abandoned assets, asset backed token development is an enormous industry brimming to dominate the way traditional finance operates. Finance institutions can directly gain the benefits of automated KYC and investor verification followed by seamless liquidation of assets. The process is scalable and in complete synchronization with the risk metrics attached.</p>
<p>As pioneers of building enterprise-grade dApps, Innovacio Solutions has been spearheading the new wave of Tokenomics. Working closely with finance corporates, our roadmap is designed in proximity with another giant economy in the making known as the DeFi (Decentralized Finance). Our asset tokenization experts bring on board exceptional expertise in asset tokenization platform development and the ripple effect caused by decentralization nuances.</p>

     <h2>High Liquidity</h2>
     <p>It qualifies illiquid assets for trade in secondary markets. The self-regulating protocol of Blockchain platforms empowers direct transfer of ownership within the compliance rules set by the smart contract. Such an opportunity to trade on regulated exchanges improves the liquidity.</p>
</div>

<div className="entp">
     <div className="entp-img entp1"></div>
     <h2>Faster and cheaper transactions</h2>
     <p>The automation done by Smart Contracts abbreviate the chances of manual validation thereby make the overarching transaction cycle faster, smarter and securer. High throughput rates on decentralized platforms fasten contract locking at drastically lower fees.</p>
</div>

<div className="entp">
     <div className="entp-img entp2"></div>
     <h2>Fractional Ownership</h2>
     <p>Enables investors to purchase a percentage of the tokenized asset. Tokenization makes the asset highly divisible for trading while empowering the small-medium scale investor to enter the market. It produces a more democratic ecosystem for anyone to sign up and purchase.</p>
</div>

<div className="entp">
     <div className="entp-img entp3"></div>
     <h2>Broader Investor Base</h2>
     <p>It results in a broader investor base to participate in the investment process. Tokenization of real world assets would open opportunities for a new set of investors and allow them to diversify their investment portfolio into assets that they could not afford previously.</p>
