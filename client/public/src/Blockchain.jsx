<h1>Challenges in Conventional Supply Chain Management</h1>
<p>The traditional supply chain management process is beset with inefficiencies, including the following:</p>
</div>
<div className="challenge-sects">
<div className="sect">
<h1>  Lack of Visibility</h1>
<p>Diverse record-keeping and reporting systems result in incomplete, siloed, and unreliable manifests, certifications, bills of lading, and more. Lack of visibility poses challenges in identifying the provenance of data.</p>
<h1>  Disconnected Supply Chain Participants</h1>
<p>A supply chain involves various independent participants – such as producers, brokers, transporters, processors, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers – who may lack trust and be hesitant to share data.</p>
<h1> Lack of Product Traceability</h1>
<p>The vague, untraceable product characteristics lead to ambiguity in the product information. Traceability problems are a result of inefficient and manual record-keeping and supply chain complexity.</p>

</div>


<div className="sect">
<h1> Costly Data Reconciliation Process</h1>
<p>Supply chain management leads to a large amount of duplicate data. Huge efforts and tedious, costly reconciliation processes are required to track data across the supply chain, from start to finish.</p>
<h1> Lack of Transparency</h1>
<p>The current supply chain management process often faces challenges knowing the real-time location of goods. In addition, the system lacks a solution to find the source of flawed parts and the origin of previously shipped goods.</p>
<h1> Delayed Operations</h1>
<p>Supply chains still rely on error-prone manual processes – whether it is preparing lading bills, record-keeping, maintaining information, and more. This manual intervention slows down the operations across the supply chain.</p>
