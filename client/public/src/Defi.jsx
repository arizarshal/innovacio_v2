Decentralized Finance Development
The Future Without Banks
</h1>
<p>
Decentralized Finance – often referred to as DeFi – involves the shift from traditional and centralized finance to peer-to-peer and decentralized technologies built on the Ethereum blockchain. The DeFi ecosystem comprises an expansive network of financial instruments including banking, payments and settlement, lending and borrowing platforms, and stablecoins.

<p>Regardless of the quality services offered by a banker, it is likely that they miss market hints and expose your financial assets to inconceivable risk. This can further lead to inevitable losses.</p>
<p>Moreover, the conventional finance ecosystem is inaccessible to many individuals and thereby prevents a large pool of investors from tapping into primary markets. As a result, excessive dependency upon capital investors has restricted their socio-economic impact.</p>

The World With Decentralized Finance
</h1>
<p>
DeFi is an opportunity for finance services providers to take a leap, embrace decentralized Blockchain development and undergo an overarching reincarnation of their products. Using open-source protocols to conceive enterprise-grade solutions, DeFi solutions empower investors gain complete ownership of their assets and trade them in a transparent environment.
</p>
<p>
To put it simply, financial engagements on DeFi are driven by automated Smart Contracts built by code. Therefore, the model extracts all the benefits of a Blockchain environment with a finance spin.
</p>
<p>
Improving access to major finance services such as lending / borrowing, trading and market making, DeFi can potentially aid millions of unbanked people. That means, all you need is an internet connection to drive your monetary functions without depending upon anyone.
</p>
<p>
Consider lending loans to any borrower in the world minus the interference of banks or regulatory bodies. This is a classic use case that ensures drastic reduction in interest rates and wider reach.
</p>
<p>
Innoacio creates a completely democratic lending environment wherein anyone can hold and invest their assets by directly engaging with the other party. Given our proven expertise in Blockchain, we pioneered decentralized finance token development.
