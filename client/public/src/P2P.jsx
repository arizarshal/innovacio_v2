            <h2>A peer-to-peer approach to trading</h2>
            <p>Utilizing the fundamental concept of blockchain technology, which is decentralization, a P2P (peer-to-peer) exchange executes transactions without any involvement of a central authority while connecting the buyers and sellers directly. The platform is powered by a smart contract-based Escrow system to foster reliable transactions.</p>
