<h1>DeFi Staking</h1>
<h1>Revolutionizing the Traditional Borrowing and Lending Paradigm</h1>
<p>DeFi staking is an activity where users hold or lock their funds to participate in maintaining the operations of a proof-of-stake (POS)-driven blockchain system. It is akin to cryptocurrency mining since it helps a network achieve consensus while incentivizing users for their participation.</p>
<p>DeFi staking redefines and facilitates the conventional process of lending and borrowing while providing much-needed transparency in the process. Owing to these benefits, DeFi staking has acquired global traction and adoption. The total assets staked in DeFi platforms amount to $21 to $23 billion in January 2021. This figure is a testament to the increasing demand for staking.</p>
<p>If you are planning to tap into the billion-dollar staking market by launching your DeFi staking software, Antier Solutions can navigate and expedite your journey.</p>

<div className="staking-platform">
<h1>DeFi Staking Platform</h1>
<p>When planning to develop DeFi staking platform, you can choose from the following to offer DeFi services.</p>
<Fade>
<div className="platform-divs">
<div className="platform-div">
<div className="platform-div-img pt-1"></div>
<h2>Exchange</h2>
<p>Crypto exchanges have forayed into the staking business, owing to the number of users on these platforms. You can leverage your existing crypto exchange or build a new one, to offer DeFi staking services.</p>
</div>

<div className="platform-div">
<div className="platform-div-img pt-2"></div>
<h2>Staking</h2>
<p>Like many businesses, you can use a crypto wallet to offer DeFi staking services to your users. It requires you to provide your users with a secure and user-friendly wallet where they can stake their assets.</p>
</div>


<div className="platform-div">
<div className="platform-div-img pt-3"></div>
<h2>Staking as a service platform</h2>
<p>Unlike exchanges and wallets that double up as trading and storage platforms respectively, staking-as-a-service software are committed to staking only. Staking on these kinds of platforms is known as soft staking.</p>

{/* Rewards Users */}
<Fade>
<div className="rewards">
<h1>Ways to Rewards Users</h1>
<h2>As a DeFi staking platform owner, you can choose the mechanism to reward your users for staking their assets on your platform.</h2>
<div className="rewards-divs">
<div className="rewards-div">
<div className="rewards-div-img rewards-img-1"></div>
<h1>Validate</h1>
<p>It involves incentivizing users for validating the blockchain. The validation tasks that are assigned to users are directly proportional to the assets held by them. Users who hold or stake more assets are assigned more validation tasks, leading to greater rewards.</p>
</div>

<div className="rewards-div">
<div className="rewards-div-img rewards-img-2"></div>
<h1>Claim</h1>
<p>This activity involves rewarding users for locking their assets on your platform for a fixed time. The rewards are calculated based on the assets that are locked – higher locked-in assets lead to higher rewards that are directly transferred to the wallets of the users.</p>
</div>

<div className="rewards-div">
<div className="rewards-div-img rewards-img-3"></div>
<h1>Delegate</h1>
<p>It includes the participation of a fund manager who operates a sizable capital. The profits made by this platform are reinvested and the dividends are equally distributed among the users. The fund manager is given a fee for his services as well as knowledge.</p>
