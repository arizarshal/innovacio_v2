         <h1>Cryptocurrency Development</h1>
         <p>Crypto coins are disrupting the global financial industry, reinventing the way we transact. Reducing the
settlement time, eliminating the middleman and boosting the security quotient, cryptocurrencies have
established themselves as a cornerstone of more secure, quick and transparent transactions. To leverage these
benefits of digital currencies, many start-ups and established organizations across the globe are venturing
into coin development, which has fueled the demand for cryptocurrency development services.</p>

<h1>Bitcoin</h1>
<p>The original coin, Bitcoin is a network driven by its participants, without any central authority. In its initial time, the currency faced certain resistance, but was gradually adopted by the people worldwide. Its idea was to eliminate double spending amounts, while waiting confirmations of the payments – a transaction becomes irreversible with the increasing number of verifications.</p>

<div className="t-coin">
<div className="t-coin-img tc-2"> </div>
<h1>Altcoins</h1>
<p>Altcoin refers to alternative coin. These projects emerge usually as a fork of another project or are created completely from scratch. They are more or less the improved versions of an existing project. Forks are of two types – the hard one is seen as a changing of the rules, which leads to creation of a completely new coin. The soft fork is somehow an updated feature of the currently existing coin.</p>

<div className="t-coin-img tc-3"> </div>
<h1>Tokens</h1>
<p>Tokens do not have their own blockchain; they are built on an already existing blockchain. Tokens can represent all kind of assets – from goods to a brand-new cryptocurrency. They are created by following a standard template on the particular platform, and distributed by ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) and STOs (Security Token Offerings) – which are basically crowdfunding solutions for a new project.</p>
