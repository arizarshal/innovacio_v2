<h2>Decentralized Finance Exchange: A Paradigm Shift</h2>
<p>There are currently 80 decentralized exchanges listed on CoinMarketCap. Many others would also be serving in the crypto world. A decentralized exchange is different from a centralized exchange in that it eliminates the involvement of a central party to control the operations. There is no middleman to drive and assess the transactions.</p>
<p>At the core of it, a decentralized exchange is underpinned by a smart contract that automates processes like order matching, transactions, and the flow of funds. These properties make decentralized exchanges a paradigm shift. They are fast, transparent, and enable users to have complete control over their accounts and assets.</p>
<p>If you are a start-up or an established organization planning to ride the wave of change, leverage our blockchain and crypto expertise to accelerate your DeFi exchange development journey.</p>
