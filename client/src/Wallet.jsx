<h1>What makes our White Label
Crypto Wallet Secure</h1>

<h3>Market-leading features that fortify the security of our wallet solution</h3>

<h2>Multi-signature Support</h2>
<p>With our multi-signature wallet, the owner can assign at most two co-signers to approve the withdrawal request when the amount exceeds the limit set by the owner.</p>

<h2>Biometric Authentication</h2>
<p>Biometric security, such as facial/fingerprint recognition executes legitimate transactions by authenticating the user every time a request to transfer crypto assets is generated.</p>

<h2>Password-Protected Access</h2>
<p>The 4-digit secure login PIN ensures authenticated access to a user’s account.</p>

<h2>Optional Session Logout</h2>
<p>Automatically logs out the session in case the user remains inactive for a certain period. This enhances the security of user's accounts and funds.</p>

<h2>Two-Factor Authentication</h2>
<p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) provides an extra layer of security to the user authentication process.</p>
